**Adaptive Deadlock Avoidance for Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems via CBF-inspired Risk Measurement**

Yanze Zhang, Yiwei Lyu, Siwon Jo, Yupeng Yang, Wenhao Luo

**IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025**

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09621)

- We present a novel decentralized framework that ensures both efficient task execution and deadlock 
resolution for multi-agent systems, which enables co-optimization 
between the task-related controller and deadlock resolution
controller, yielding smoother robots‚Äô motion with improved overall task execution efficiency

**Courteous MPC for Autonomous Driving with CBF-inspired Risk Assessment**

Yanze Zhang, Yiwei Lyu, Sude E. Demir, Xingyu Zhou, Yupeng Yang, Junming Wang, Wenhao Luo

**IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2024**

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12822v1)

- we develop an extension of the CBF-inspired risk evaluation framework that takes into account both noisy observed positions and motions, which are then integrated with MPC to ensure smooth and robust decision-making for AVs.
