My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>control theory</b>, <b>robotics</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. More specifically, my Ph.D. research focuses on the provably safe collaboration of multiple robots (quadrotors and mobile robots), and safe learning based control techniques for robotics. <br>

<p> 
R1. <b> Safe Certificate-Based Maneuvers for Teams of Quadrotors </b> <br>
* Developed safety control certificates to ensure safe aggressive maneuvers of multi-quadrotor and mobile robot swarms <br>
* Implemented safety certificates on teams of quadrotors and robots with Robot Operating System (ROS) (C++, Python). <br>
* Programmed stable hovering and trajectory tracking of quadrotors with Extended Kalman Filter and sensor fusion.

R2. <b> Safe Learning of Quadrotor Dynamics with Barrier Certificates </b> <br>
* Developed online learning method for highly nonlinear quadrotor dynamics using recursive online Gaussian Process. <br>
* Designed safe control certificates for the quadrotor to learn unknown wind field with safety guarantees. <br>
* Implemented Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the states of quadrotors with motion tracking and IMU data.
<br>
* Implemented learning algorithms based on LWPR, Gaussian Process, Sparse Spectrum GP, and Eigen GP.

R3. <b> Safe Swarm Robotic and Multi-objective Compositions </b> <br >
* Developed multi-objective composition strategy for provably safe and connected multi-robot collaboration. <br>
* Designed Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming based optimization algorithm to search for permissive barrier certificates. <br>
* Implemented multi-objective composition algorithms on multiple Khepera III robots and Magellan Pro robots.  <br>
* Integrated real-time control and communication between different robots and devices on Robot Operating System (ROS). <br>
