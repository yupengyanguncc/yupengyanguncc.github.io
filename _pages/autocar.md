Self-driving car is an amazing technology revolution that might shape the future and impact people around the world. I am currently working on the second term of [Udacity Self-driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). Some of the interesting projects I've done are shared in this blog.
